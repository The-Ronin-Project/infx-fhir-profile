# dp-ronin-fhir-profile
The Ronin oncology FHIR profile assembles a core set of structured data elements for oncology based on FHIR 4.0.1 and mCODE™ standards.  While mCODE™ is a step towards capturing research-quality data from the treatment of all cancer patients, Ronin's profile modifies/extends mCODE™ to include partner-specific information necessary for Ronin's products.
